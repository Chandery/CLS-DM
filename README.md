# Consistent Latent Space Diffusion Model (CLS-DM)
## Overview
This repository contains the implementation of the Consistent Latent Space Diffusion Model (CLS-DM), a novel approach designed to enhance three-dimensional computed tomography (CT) reconstruction from sparse two-dimensional X-ray images. Leveraging cross-modal feature contrastive learning, CLS-DM effectively extracts latent three-dimensional information and facilitates alignment between the latent spaces of X-ray and CT modalities.
## Research Context
Computed Tomography (CT) is a prevalent imaging technique employed in clinical practice; however, conventional CT processes are often hindered by challenges such as high radiation exposure and extended imaging time. This project aims to address these issues by utilizing sparse X-ray views, thus reducing both risk and cost while maintaining reconstruction quality.

The CLS-DM integrates advanced diffusion modeling techniques, demonstrating superior performance in voxel-level metrics (PSNR, SSIM) compared to existing classical and state-of-the-art generative models.

## Features
- Efficient extraction of latent three-dimensional information from two-dimensional X-ray images.
- Performance benchmarked against several classical and state-of-the-art models.
- Open-source code implementation for reproducibility and further research.
